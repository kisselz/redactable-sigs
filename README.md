Overview
========

This project iplements redactable signature schemes for sets. Redactable signature schemes were
first described by [Johsnson, Molnar, Song, and Wagner](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/papers/homsig.pdf)
and [Steinfeld, Bull, and Zheng](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/sites.uab.edu/dist/a/68/files/2020/01/cesproc-icisc01-p285.pdf).
The provided code implements the set constructions in the accompanying paper ["Policy-Based Redactable Signatures"](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1485).

A good survey of the work up to 2015 is [A General Framework for Redactable Signatures and New Constructions](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1059.pdf)
by Derler, P&ouml;hls, Samelin, and Slamanig

***WARNING***: This code is only intended for experimental purposes. No warranty
is stated nor implied about the fitness of this code for deployment.

Building
========
The project can be built using Apache Ant. The targets are:

* build: build this the project producing a jar file in the dist directory and
class file in the build directory.
* api: builds the javadoc api into a directory called api.
* clean: cleans all of the autogenerated directories.
* run: runs the JAR file created by build (implicitly invokes the build target).
* setup: downloads the necessary jar files an puts them in lib. Automatically invoked 
  by the build target.
  
Build Dependencies
------------------
* Apache Ant
* Java JDK 16+
* [Java Pairing Based Crypto Library](http://gas.dia.unisa.it/projects/jpbc/)
