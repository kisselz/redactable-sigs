Overview
========

This project investigates methods for constructing Redactable Signature Schemes
as first described by [Johsnson, Molnar, Song, and Wagner](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/papers/homsig.pdf)
and [Steinfeld, Bull, and Zheng](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/sites.uab.edu/dist/a/68/files/2020/01/cesproc-icisc01-p285.pdf).
The provided code implements all existing constructions as well as providing support for new constructions.

A good survey of the work up to 2015 is [A General Framework for Redactable Signatures and New Constructions](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1059.pdf)
by Derler, P&oum;hls, Samelin, and Slamanig

***WARNING***: This code is only intended for experimental purposes. No warranty
is stated nor implied about the fitness of this code for deployment.

Building
========
The project can be built using Apache Ant. The targets are:

* build: build this the project producing a jar file in the dist directory and
class file in the build directory.
* api: builds the javadoc api into a directory called api.
* clean: cleans all of the autogenerated directories.
* run: runs the JAR file created by build (implicitly invokes the build target).
